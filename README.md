Practice memory reduction with UCI database
In these examples I have downloaded a UCI dataset Audiology to notepad.
Using jupyter notebook and pandas.
Object variables where first sorted then changed to categorical using .astype('category')

First example is just for one variable.

Second example is a function for all columns
Thus reducing memory of entire file by 33%
